# Designs in CSS

Welcome to the repository that contains a collection of programming projects implemented in CSS. This repository was created to share a variety of projects that can serve as inspiration, learning, and practical application of the CSS language.

## About the repository

These projects cover various areas such as:

## How to use the repository

You can freely browse through available projects and choose those that interest you. Each project contains a description, source code and sometimes sample data or result files.

If you are interested in a specific design, you can use the code as a starting point for styling your websites. You can customize the designs to suit your needs, experiment with different effects and looks to achieve unique designs.

I encourage you to participate in the development of the repository by adding your own projects, submitting comments and suggestions, sharing your experiences and collaborating with other programmers. Our goal is to create a rich collection of projects and share knowledge and inspiration.

I invite you to use the available projects, explore their code, learn new techniques and tools, as well as share your projects and create a community of CSS developers.
